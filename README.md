## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used concepts that i already knew. The only thing i learned was that we can put two backgrounds images and we can position them.

```scss
background-image: url("/images/bg-pattern-top.svg"),
  url("/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
background-position: right 50vw bottom 50vh, left 50vw top 50vh;
```

### Continued development

I will practice my sass.
